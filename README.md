# LSF Quiz Back

This is the back-end of this application. You can find the front end by clicking [here](http://google.fr). **All the videos and images are not provided**. I advise creating a folder in the public folder and creating two folders, videos and images. All the media must have the answer as  title (the file extension will be removed by the back end).

This application has been made to help learn sign language. The principle is simple, you can select two exercises :
- Test your understanding knowledge by watching a video and guessing the word
- Test your knowledge of the sign language alphabet

This application is basic, but meets the needs we have. 

## Project setup

```

Before starting it, you must fill the .env file with your Media_path, video path and image path.
